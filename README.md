# Building Geospatial multi-layer apps with Snowflake and Streamlit


## Overview
In this guide you will learn how to analyse and transform geospatial data in Snowflake. You will be covering:

A progressive learning experience from viewing points on a map, right through to building a multi-layer app - which pulls together everything you have learned.

A use case investigation on sample roof data based on 3 locations within the United Kingdom. You will pull this together with weather data to understand how much energy can be taken from the current roofs of buildings if solar powered panels were installed.

A use case investigation on how you can call an Api to get the latest flood warnings and how flood risk zones impact the buildings which were loaded into the previous use case.
